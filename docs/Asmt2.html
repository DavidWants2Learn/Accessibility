        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        As a student veteran I understand the importance of being cooperative in a team. <br>
        Each individual contributes to a team in a unique way, <br>
        and it is this that makes the sum of the whole that makes a dynamic system function. <br>
        During my time in the US Army, I was physically weaker but more compassionate than <br>
        most of my team members. I felt as if I weren’t able to contribute as much as my teammates. <br>
        I eventually noticed that the local’s in Iraq felt less threatened <br>
        by me and would share information that kept my platoon safe. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I am a driven individual whose been set back by personal and financial circumstances, <br>
        but i’ve never given up on my education. After leaving the military, <br>
        I had a difficult time adjusting back into society, and my financial circumstances <br>
        made it almost impossible to continue my education. However, I persevered <br>
        by making some sacrifices such as renting a living room, sleeping on couches, <br>
        and eating cheap to make it possible. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I’ve been told that I am a diligent worker. Once I get into the zone, <br>
        I don’t stop working until I am satisfied with the outcome. <br>
        One of the most difficult projects that I worked on was creating a <br>
        digital safe using the ARM Assembly language. Although it took me over <br>
        2 weeks of non-stop learning, and coding. I was finally able to complete the project. <br>
        The professor later noted that I was the only person that completed the project <br>
        in my own unique way, without referencing the examples that were available online. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        What I hope to gain in this course is to be able empathize with the user <br>
        by developing intuitive applications that are simple and easy to use. <br>

            The role in accessibility that I hope to play in the future,
            is to have disabled users in mind whilst I develop websites.
            In order to create websites that are acccesible to a wider 
            audience.
